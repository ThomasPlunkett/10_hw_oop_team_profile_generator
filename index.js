// THIS IS WHERE MY MAIN LOGIC WILL LIE

// You would first REQUIRE all the files and node packages needed
//Engineer, 

// BECAUSE I'M PUTTING page-template.js IN ANOTHER FOLDER (src),  
// REQUIRE that page-template.js
const pageTemplate = require('./src/page-template.js');
// USE pageTemplate as a function, which can ACCEPT a parameter
pageTemplate(team);

// INDEX FILES ARE CONSIDERED THE ENTRY POINT TO MY APPLICATION

// IF THIS IS YOUR ENTRY POINT, I MUST DO INQUIRER HERE

// THIS IS WHERE I DO MY FS WRITEFILE STUFF

// THE DIST FOLDER IS WHERE THE OUTPUT HTML FILES WILL LAND
